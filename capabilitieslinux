The new flag supports, in Docker, a security feature that was added to the Linux kernel back in 2012 under the name no_new_privs.

The kernel feature works as follows:

    A process can set the no_new_privs bit in the kernel that persists across fork, clone, and exec.
    The no_new_privs bit ensures that the process or its children processes do not gain any additional privileges.
    A process isnâ€™t allowed to unset the no_new_privs bit once it is set.
    Processes with no_new_privs are not allowed to change uid/gid or gain any other capabilities, even if the process executes setuid binaries or executables with file capability bits set.
    no_new_privs also prevents Linux Security Modules (LSMs) like SELinux from transitioning to process labels that have access not allowed to the current process. This means an SELinux process is only allowed to transition to a process type with less privileges.
